# Tzomet-Sfarim

On this site I built a site for a book junction,
on this site you have the option of getting all the books in stock including all their full details,
you have the option to search for books as you wish, and there is the option of adding books to the stock.

Languages I used:

Server side - Node.js, Client side - Angular, Typescript.

database : phpMyAdmin.
